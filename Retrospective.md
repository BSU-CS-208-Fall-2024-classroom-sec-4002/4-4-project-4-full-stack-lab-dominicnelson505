## Experience

I had never used Pug templates before so that was pretty cool seeing how those work
with dynamic HTMl generation. It was also my first time using SQLite while really integrating 
front and backend software to each other.

## Known issues or Bugs

My biggest isue was quite a simple one but it was getting the path names and everything to work 
properly in this environment. It had been a little bit since the last time I really did any Javascript 
and that was kind of throwing me off.
